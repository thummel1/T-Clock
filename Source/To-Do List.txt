Requests: From DC Member: freaky44
- It would be great to have the option to see the size and number of files of
  the recycle bin in the Mouse-over Tooltip Text. (e.g. "10 Files, 135 MB").

- I would love to have the option to set the action in mouse-properties to
  "open files/folders (with command-line switches)". Just like you can do
  it in the "Menu Item Details". Then i could empty/open the recycle bin
  with just one click.

NEED Adjustable Blink Color (and Blink Test) - Defaults cause the blink to be transparent.

DONE - From Sagji/DonationCoder.com - When creating an alarm it is difficult to enter the time

		field is a little better - or I was just more experienced at the field's oddities.
